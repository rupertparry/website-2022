I'm a software developer &amp; product designer, with a focus on frontier tech. I bridge the
gap between what *is* and what *could be* to solve problems, reveal opportunities, and make magic.

I keep on coming back to these themes...

- Empowering individuals to use and shape new technologies, especially
  machine learning *(which remains as powerful as it is
  intractible to ordinary people)*
- Natural user interface design: computing that fits into healthy
  human behaviours, and feels magical *(think Harry Potter, not Minority
  Report)*
- Open protocols, or how we can build the next wave of computing without isolating
  power in like 3 companies
- Using technology to unlock memory &amp; nostalgia, and preserve culture for
  future generations *(this one's a problem for later...)*

I'm working on an early-stage product aimed at enabling musicians to create
adaptive music &mdash; songs that can delightfully evolve according to time, location,
biometrics, and other factors.

I recently wrapped up my time as lead technologist at
<a href="https://heydaylabs.co" target="_blank">Heyday Labs</a>, where I
worked with clients like Google &amp; the UK Government to create experiences
&amp; early-stage products.

Before that I was a creative technologist at
<a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/search?q=google%20creative%20lab"

- <a href="https://moonhotline.tourdemoon.com" target="_blank">Moon Hotline</a> is a re-imagining of how we
  might interact with conversational user interfaces. It's an AI interactive
  theatre piece, where you can have a wide-ranging conversation with a
  curious and sometimes argumentative Moon. It was commissioned by
  the UK Government for Unboxed, a nation-wide festival for innovation, art and
  culture. I lead the development and design, working with WeTransfer on front-end
  UX, overseeing a team of writers, and building the logic and API in Python.
- *Sheets For Humans* (internal) is an add-on for Google Sheets that allows users to solve
  problems faster with the help of machine learning, all in a familiar and
  flexible software
  environment &mdash; the spreadsheet. The tool allows users to pull in data from
  APIs, detect objects in images, analyse text sentiment, answer questions using
  large language models, and graph the results. I
  was the lead developer & designer for this project, which emerged from an
  exploration with Google into the future of Sheets.
- I built a series of <a
  href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/aiwriting" target="_blank">AI tools for
  writers</a> and
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbKsRJ5MsnA" target="_blank">musicians</a> with Google. We explored how
  AI could be a creative collaboration tool, through
  hands-on research and rapid prototyping with writers and artists. The
  resulting apps spawned a
  series of short stories featured in the <a
  href="https://2019.digitalwritersfestival.com/event/creativity-inside-the-machine/"
  target="_blank">Digital Writers
  Festival</a>,
  and were presented at the <a
  href="https://www.aria.com.au/awards/news/aria-masterclass-machine-learning-ai-music"
  target="_blank">2020 ARIA
  Masterclass</a>.
- <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/sounds-in-space" target="_blank">Sounds In Space</a> is a
  toolkit for developing location-based audio AR experiences. You can walk
  around a room with your phone, drop virtual instruments in space, then walk
  around while a band "plays" in the room with you. The tech has been used by
  <a href="https://heidilatskydance.org/displayed" target="_blank">dance troupes in Harlem</a> and led to a
  <a href="https://vimeo.com/393792407" target="_blank">public art exhibition at MUMA</a>. It's freely
  available <a href="https://github.com/googlecreativelab/sounds-in-space" target="_blank">here</a>.

I'm a software developer &amp; product designer. I bridge the
gap between what *is* and what *could be* to solve problems, reveal opportunities, and make magic.

I keep on coming back to these themes...

- Empowering individuals to use and shape new technologies, especially
  machine learning *(which remains as powerful as it is
  intractible to ordinary people)*
- Natural user interface design: computing that fits into natural
  human behaviour, and feels magical *(think Harry Potter, not Minority
  Report)*
- Open protocols, or how we can build the next wave of computing without isolating
  power in like 3 companies
- Using technology to unlock memory &amp; nostalgia, and preserve culture for
  future generations *(this one's a problem for later...)*

## Current status

I'm working on an early-stage startup aimed at enabling musicians to create
adaptive music &mdash; songs that can delightfully evolve according to time, location,
biometrics, and other factors.

I recently wrapped up my time as lead technologist at
<a href="https://heydaylabs.co" target="_blank">Heyday Labs</a>, where I
worked with clients like Google &amp; the UK Government to create experiences
&amp; early-stage products.

Before that I was a creative technologist at
<a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/search?q=google%20creative%20lab"

  <p>I'm a software developer &amp; product designer. I bridge the
gap between what <em>is</em> and what <em>could be</em> to solve problems, reveal opportunities, and make magic.</p>
<p>I keep on coming back to these themes...</p>
<ul>
<li>Empowering individuals to use and shape new technologies, especially
machine learning <em>(which remains as powerful &amp; magical as it is
intractible to ordinary people)</em></li>
<li>Natural user interface design: computing that fits into healthy, embodied human lives,
and feels magical <em>(Harry Potter, not Minority Report)</em></li>
<li>Open protocols, or how we can build the next wave of computing without isolating
power in like 3 companies</li>
<li>Using technology to unlock memory &amp; nostalgia, and preserve culture for
future generations <em>(this one's a problem for later...)</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Current status</h2>
<p>I'm working on an early-stage startup aimed at enabling musicians to create
adaptive music ‚Äî songs that can delightfully evolve according to time, location,
biometrics, and other factors.</p>
<p>I recently wrapped up my time as lead technologist at Heyday Labs, where I
worked with clients like Google &amp; the UK Government to create experiences
&amp; early-stage products.</p>
<p>Before that I was a creative technologist at Google Creative Lab.</p>
